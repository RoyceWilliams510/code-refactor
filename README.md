# code-refactor

The objective of this project was to refactor the given code from our client Horiseon, and adjust the files to meet higher accessibility standards. Examples of how the file was improved on are: including alt attributes on all of the images, adding semantic HTML elements, and adjusting the HTML elements to have a logical order.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

For all users the first thing you are going to need is to install git. If you already have git installed and have configured your account onto your local machine, then skip the following steps and go to the installing section. You can find the instructions on how to download and install the git software for  operating systems of Linux, Mac and Windows at the following link:

Once you are on the page select the corresponding download link to the operating system of your own machine and follow the instructions.

After having installed the software and have created your own github account, you will now have to link your account to your local machine and you can do this by following the instructions at this link:
